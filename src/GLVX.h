 * be changed, if, for example, glScalef() is called.
 * The sample ratio is simply multiplied onto the calculated number of curve samples.
 * It therefore begins at 1 -- total samples is equal to 100% of pixel-based sample
 * estimates.
 * Generally, the sample ratio should correspond to the scale at which objects are
